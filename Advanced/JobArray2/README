Job arrays are useful to launch parameter sweeps for example.
They are most useful on Aries and Castor, where allocations are made on a by-core basis.

For an example on other cluster, please see the FakeJobArray example.

For a specific example on Matlab, see the Matlab/JobArray directory in Modules.
