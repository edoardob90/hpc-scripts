This test is ready to submit to the nodes with the file:
job.gromacs.slurm

It's a simple test that will run in a few seconds.

If the code finds available GPU, it will run on it. Otherwise it
reverts to the CPU only.
It produces a file called:
md.log

with some stats. It also produces a trajectory file, traj.trr,
with 62 MB.
