This test is ready to submit to the nodes with the file:
job.adf.slurm

It's a simple test that will run in a few seconds.

It produces a file called:
test.out

WARNING: Currently, due to licensing issues, ADF only runs on Bellatrix.
If needed, it can run on Deneb, but since the need hasn't arisen up, I
haven't contacted the company. So, the job will run only in Bellatrix, not
on Deneb.
