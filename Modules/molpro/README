This test is ready to submit to the nodes with the file:
job.molpro.slurm

It's a simple test that will run in a few seconds.
Alternatively, a more real-case test is available with: test_big.inp
The job.molpro.slurm has to be adjusted to use that file and that job
should run in around 5 minutes.

It produces two files called:
test.[out,xml] (test_big.[out,xml])
