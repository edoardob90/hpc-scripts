# How to use these examples

Submit the job with the command:
```
sbatch job.fluent.slurm
```

## Input files:
fluent-test.cas
fluent-test.jou

## Output files:
fluent-test.cas (its content changes)
fluent-test.dat

## Comments:
* The input file (here fluent-test.jou) contains
   the appropriate Fluent text commands (TUI).
* The case file (here fluent-test.cas) should have
   been created through interactive run of Fluent
   on a PC or on the front-end of the cluster.
* job.fluent.slurm -> 1 node / 16 processors
   job2.fluent.slurm -> 2 nodes / 32 processors


# Problem with the second example (job2.fluent.slurm)?
You are trying to use the second example, but you have an error such as:
*Host key verification failed.
Error: It seems ssh is trying to verify authenticity of h193. Please resolve it and try again!*

**Workaround:**
From your home directory, change to `.ssh`

Type the following command:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`

Do not enter any passphrase!

You'll get a id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files.

Add the content of the *id_rsa.pub* into *authorized_keys* file
(if it doesn't exit, just create it: `touch authorized_keys`).

Then, create a config file (`vi config`) and add the following:
```
Host *
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
```
