HOWTO run ParaView on the EPFL Central Facilities
-------------------------------------------------


1. Prerequisites

You should download the Paraview binary installer for your machine. The binary must match the version installed on the cluster.

http://www.paraview.org/download/

These instructions only work if you are within the EPFL network. If you are not, please use the VPN. You will need to find out your IP address and insert it in the paraview.run file.

Your data will need to be on the clusters (where it is supposed to be).

You will need to have the server running before connecting with the client.

2. Client configuration

On your machine, launch the client and configure it as a client as follows:

 - click File -> connect
 - Add server: enter the name of the cluster (for example bellatrix.epfl.ch) and choose Server Type Client / Server (reverse connection)
 - in the advanced options, Choose Startup Type: Manual

3. Server configuration

Modify the paraview.run file to suit your needs. In particular, make sure you:
 - set the PVCLIENT variable to your client IP address
 - load the module corresponding to the correct version

run sbatch paraview.run

4. Connect with the client

Run the example:
Load the data with File -> Open
Apply the D31 load balancing filter
Apply the "Process Id Scalars" filter
Show usage with Show -> memory inspector

You should now have something similar to the paraview.png picture in this folder.
