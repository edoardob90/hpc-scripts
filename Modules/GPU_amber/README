This test is ready to submit to the nodes with the file:
job.amber.slurm

It's a simple test that will run in a few minutes.

It runs locally to the nodes by using SLURM_TMPDIR and rsyncing
the files before submitting the job. As such, there's no output
during the job.
It produces a file called:
md.out

with some stats. It also produces a trajectory file:
AAAT.1.trj
